# WKWebViewNowPlayingInfoDemo

In sample app, we register remote command and nowPlayingCenter when tap on play button.
First, we will successfully register information on NowPlayingInfoCenter. 
However, when wkwebview is opened and played any youtube content, NowPlayingInfoCenter information will be changed.
But, we couldn't register it back when webview is closed unless we kill app.
